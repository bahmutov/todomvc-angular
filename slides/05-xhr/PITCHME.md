## ‚òÄÔ∏è Part 5: Control network calls

### üìö You will learn

- how to spy on / stub network calls
- how to wait for the network calls from tests
- how to use network calls in assertions

+++

- keep `todomvc` app running
- open `05-xhr/spec.cy.ts`
- use the `cy.intercept` command

üìñ Fun read: [Cypress Network Requests Guide](https://on.cypress.io/network-requests) and [https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-intercept-problems/](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-intercept-problems/)

---

## Situation

- there is **no resetting** the state before each test
- the test passes but _something is wrong_

```javascript
it('starts with zero items', () => {
  cy.visit('/');
  cy.get('li.todo').should('have.length', 0);
});
```

![Should have failed](./img/test-passes-but-this-is-wrong.png)

+++

## Problem

- page loads
- web application makes XHR call "GET /todos"
  - meanwhile it shows an empty list of todos
- Cypress assertion passes! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "GET /todos" returns with 2 items <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - they are added to the DOM
  - but the test has already finished

---

## Waiting

```javascript
// 05-xhr/spec.cy.ts
it('starts with zero items (waits)', () => {
  cy.visit('/');
  cy.wait(1000);
  cy.get('li.todo').should('have.length', 0);
});
```

![Waiting works](./img/waiting.png)

+++

There might be multiple delays: loading the page, fetching todos, rendering data on the page.

![Page load diagram](./img/get-todos.png)

+++

## Wait for application signal

```js
// app.component.ts
TodoRestService.loadTodos()
  .then(todos => {
    this.loaded = true;
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // an easy way for the application to signal
    // that it is done loading
    this.loaded = true;
  });
```

```html
<div id="app" [ngClass]="{ loaded }"></div>
```

+++

**TODO:** write a test that waits for the app element to have class "loaded" after the visit

‚å®Ô∏è test "starts with zero items (check loaded class)"

```html
<div id="app" [ngClass]="{ loaded }"></div>
```

+++

Does your test still work if the application takes 5 seconds to start loading the todos?

```js
cy.visit('/?delay=5000');
```

+++

**better** to wait on a specific XHR request. Network is just observable public effect, just like DOM.

+++

### Todo

Use the test "starts with zero items" in the file `05-xhr/spec.cy.ts`

- spy on specific route with "cy.intercept" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - should we set the spy _before_ or _after_ `cy.visit`?
- save as an alias <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- wait for this XHR alias <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - then check the DOM

**tips:** [`cy.intercept`]('https://on.cypress.io/intercept), [Network requests guide](https://on.cypress.io/network-requests)

+++

üí° No need to `cy.wait(...).then(...)`. All Cypress commands will be chained automatically.

```js
cy.intercept('GET', '/todos').as('todos');
cy.visit('/');
cy.wait('@todos');
// cy.get() will run AFTER cy.wait() finishes
cy.get('li.todo').should('have.length', 0);
```

---

## Todo

add to the test "starts with zero items":

- wait for the XHR alias like before
- its response body should be an empty array

![Checking response body](./img/response-body.png)

---

## Todo

There are multiple tests in the "spec.js" that you can go through

- 'starts with zero items (delay)'
- 'starts with zero items (delay plus render delay)'
- 'starts with zero items (check loaded class)'
- 'starts with zero items (check the window property)'
- 'starts with N items'
- 'starts with N items and checks the page'

**Tip:** read [https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/app-loaded/](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/app-loaded/)

---

## Stub the network call

Update test "starts with zero items (stubbed response)"

- instead of just spying on XHR call, let's return some mock data

```javascript
// returns an empty list
// when `GET /todos` is requested
cy.intercept('GET', '/todos', []);
```

+++

```javascript
it('starts with zero items (fixture)', () => {
  // stub `GET /todos` with fixture "empty-list"

  // visit the page
  cy.visit('/');

  // then check the DOM
  cy.get('li.todo').should('have.length', 0);
});
```

**tip:** use [`cy.fixture`](https://on.cypress.io/fixture) command

+++

```javascript
it('loads several items from a fixture', () => {
  // stub route `GET /todos` with data from a fixture file "two-items.json"
  // THEN visit the page
  cy.visit('/');
  // then check the DOM: some items should be marked completed
  // we can do this in a variety of ways
});
```

**Bonus:** import the JSON fixture directly into the spec file for simplicity

---

### Spying on adding an item network call

When you add an item through the DOM, the app makes `POST` XHR call.

![Post new item](./img/post-item.png)

Note:
It is important to be able to use DevTools network tab to inspect the XHR and its request and response.

+++

**Todo 1/3**

- write a test "posts new item to the server" that confirms that new item is posted to the server

![Post new item](./img/post-item.png)

Note:
see instructions in the `05-xhr/spec.js` for the test

+++

**Todo 2/3**

- write a test "posts new item to the server response" that confirms that RESPONSE when a new item is posted to the server

![Post new item response](./img/post-item-response.png)

Note:
see instructions in the `05-xhr/spec.cy.ts` for the test

+++

**Todo 3/3**

- after you waited for the intercept once, you can use `cy.get('@alias')` to get its as many times as needed. Verify the request body and the response body of the intercept. Implement the test "'confirms the request and the response"

![Post new item response](./img/post-item-response.png)

Note:
see instructions in the `05-xhr/spec.cy.ts` for the test

**Question:** which requests do you spy on, which do you stub?

---

## Caching

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with the browser caching the data. If the browser caches the data, the server might return "304" HTTP code.

‚å®Ô∏è test "shows the items loaded from the server"

---

## Testing the loading element

In the application we are showing (very quickly) "Loading" state

```html
<div *ngIf="loading" class="loading-container">
  <div class="loading" v-show="loading">
    Loading data ...
  </div>
</div>
```

+++

## Todo

- delay the loading XHR request
- assert the UI is showing "Loading" element
- assert the "Loading" element goes away after XHR completes

‚å®Ô∏è test "shows loading element"

**Note:** most querying commands have the built-in `should('exist')` assertion, thus in this case we need to use `should('be.visible')` and `should('not.exist')` assertions.

---

## Refactor a failing test

```js
// 05-xhr/spec.cy.ts
// can you fix this test?
it.skip('confirms the right Todo item is sent to the server', () => {
  const id = cy.wait('@postTodo').then(intercept => {
    // assert the response fields
    return intercept.response.body.id;
  });
  console.log(id);
});
```

‚å®Ô∏è test "refactor example"

+++

## Even better assertions: cy-spok

```js
cy.wait('@postTodo')
  .its('response')
  .should(
    spok({
      statusCode: 201,
      body: {
        title,
        completed,
        id: spok.string
      }
    })
  )
  .its('body.id')
  .then(cy.log);
```

---

### Let's test an edge data case

User cannot enter blank titles. What if our database has old data records with blank titles which it returns on load? Does the application show them? Does it crash? **Todo:** write the test `handles todos with blank title`

![Test with a blank todo text](./img/blank.png)

---

## Anything can be intercepted

‚å®Ô∏è test "can rewrite HTML and CSS"

![A fun test add elements to the page](./img/rewrite-html-css.png)

---

## Test periodic network requests

The application loads Todos every minute

```js
// how would you test the periodic loading of todos?
setTimeout(loadTodos, delay);
setInterval(loadTodos, 60_000);
```

+++

## Application clock

- learn about controlling the web page clock [https://on.cypress.io/stubs-spies-and-clocks](https://on.cypress.io/stubs-spies-and-clocks)
- use [cy.clock](https://on.cypress.io/clock) and [cy.tick](https://on.cypress.io/tick) commands

+++

## Todo

- set up a test "loads todos every minute" that intercepts the `GET /todos` with different responses using `times: 1` option
- advance the clock by 1 minute and confirm different responses are displayed

‚å®Ô∏è test "test periodic loading"

+++

![This fast test makes the app think 3 minutes have passed](./img/every-minute.png)

---

## Wait for Network Idle (advanced)

You can spy on every network request and keep track of its timestamp. Waiting for network idle means waiting for the network request to be older than N milliseconds before continuing the test.

**Todo:** implement the test "waits for the network to be idle for 2 seconds". Bonus for logging the timings.

---
